## **1. Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Isomorphism Test**

<br/>

- **Graph Isomorphism**


    <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/16d6b9c8-9971-4b47-9984-4ae777aacb3a" width="450">

    &emsp; Graph 1 and 2 are isomorphic, meaning that their adjacency matrices are equivalent under permutation.

    - Two graphs G and H are isomorphic if there exists a bijective mapping $\large f\, :\, V(G) \rightarrow V(H)$ between their vertex sets that preserves the adjacency relationships.

    - More formally, for two graphs $\large G(V, E, X_{v})$ and $\large G'(V', E', X_{v}')$, there exists a permutation $\large \Pi$ such that $\large \Pi V \, = \, V', \, \Pi E \, = \, E', \, \Pi X_{v} \, = \, X_{v}'$ where $\large \Pi(u,v) \, = \, (\Pi u, \Pi v)$.

- **Graph Automorphism**

    - An automorphism of a graph G is an isomorphism from G to itself.

    - Permutation of the vertices of the graph that preserves the graph's structure.

- **Notations**

    - $\large G(V, E, X_{v})$ : a graph with vertex set $\large V$, edge set $\large E$, and node features $\large X_{v} \, \in \, \mathbb{R}^{d}$.

    - $\large \vec{v} \, = \, (v_{1}, v_{2}, ..., v_{k}) \, \in \, \mathbb{R}^{k}$ : a k-tuple of nodes

    - $\large c_{v}^{l}$ : state of node $\large v$ or $\large \vec{v}$ at iteration $\large l$.

    - $\large hash \, : \, X_{v} \rightarrow c_{v}^{l}$ : a bijective function that maps colors to nodes (or k-tuples of nodes) based on the node features or multiset of node features. 

    - \{\{\}\} : a multiset (set that allows multiplicity). Two multisets are equal (their hash values are equal) if they share same elements with same multiplicities. (Any multisets are sorted before hashed.)

<br/>

### **1.1. WL Test**

<br/>

- WL test (1-WL test) is a classical isomorphism based on color refinement where the color of each node is updated in each iteration based on the aggregated color representation of its neighboring nodes.

- Iterates the same process untill the refinement stabilizes with no further update from previous states.

<br/>

### **1.2. k-WL Test**

<br/>

- The problem of 1-WL test where the hash function only refers to the state of a single node is that it's too heuristic and fails to distinguish non-isomorphism in a simple case where two graphs have same number of nodes and every node has same degree. 

- A straightforward solution to this is simply to extend the set of nodes referred to update the state from a single node to k-tuples of nodes. 

    - $\large c_{v}^{l} \, = \, hash(X_{v})$ for $\large v \, \in \, V$ &emsp; $\large \rightarrow$ &emsp; $\large c_{\vec{v}}^{l} \, = \, hash(G(\vec{v}))$ where $\large \vec{v}$ is k-dimensional. 

    - Neighborhood of $\large \vec{v}$, $\large N_{i}(\vec{v})$ is defined as the set of k-tuple of nodes that differ with $\large \vec{v}$ only in the position $\large i$. 

        &emsp;<img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/a61f881f-e4ec-4c9f-8f06-1deb417e6b0d" width="520">

        - $\large N_{i}(\vec{v}) \, \in \, \mathbb{R}^{n \times k \times k}$

        - Example : $\large N_{i}(\vec{v})$ for k = 2, n = 6 (just focus on the dimensions)

- Except for the fact that coloring is performed based on the k-tuples of nodes, the basic algorithm of color refinement is identical with the 1-WL test.

<br/>

### **1.3. k-FWL Test**

<br/>

- k-FWL (folklore-WL) is almost idential to the k-WL with a slight difference in the definition of neighborhood. 

    &emsp;<img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/74f6aeeb-1a5e-4a38-a1df-42334841e78c" width="520">

    - $\large N_{i}^{F}(\vec{v}) \, \in \, \mathbb{R}^{k \times n \times k}$ 

        - Example of $\large N_{i}^{F}(\vec{v})$ for the same case (k = 2, node = 6)

        &emsp;&emsp; <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/2abf7ee0-2b9b-42b4-9724-9612e6cf7723" width="300">

<br/>

### **1.4. Comparison between k-WL and k-FWL**

<br/>

- This seemingly trivial change in the definition of neighborhood distinguishes k-FWL from k-WL, such that the discriminating power of k-WL is equivalent to the one of (k-1)-FWL for k greater than 3.

- Let's take a closer look at how can these two algorithms differ in terms of dicriminating isomorphism with an example provided with a great detail. 

&emsp; <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/362b9f1f-f0ce-4181-8ff6-a641035078e3" width="500">

- These two graphs G and H are non-isomorphic example that the classical WL test and 2-WL test fails to distinguish, but 2-FWL succeeds. 

- Intially, there are only two isomorphic types in both cases. **1. Connected** colored in yellow, **2.Not Connected** colored in gray. (All nodes have either 0 or 2 degree).

- **First Iteration of Color Refinement in 2-WL**

    <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/b79b1fcc-a79f-4ea0-a83a-e0c55d556f00" widht="520">

    - As shown in the figure above, All 2-tuples of nodes share same multiset, which gives the same neighborhoods for all nodes.

        <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/81aaaaf1-d26a-468d-b689-c5e89d179f2e" width="380">  

    - Then the color update in $\large G_{1}$ and $\large H_{1}$ depends on the initial isomorphic type (gray or yellow).

        - $\large hash(grey, \, c_{\vec{v}, 1}^{1}, \, c_{\vec{v}, 2}^{1})$ &emsp; → &emsp; orange

        - $\large hash(yellow, \, c_{\vec{v}, 1}^{1}, \, c_{\vec{v}, 2}^{1})$ &emsp; → &emsp; brown

    - Thus, color pattern doesn't change for every node and the 2-WL terminates, concluding that two graphs are isomorphic. 

- **First Iteration of Color Refinement in 2-FWL**

    - In contrast, the first color update in 2-FWL where neighborhood contains k n-dimensional elements gives different color pattern for each graph. 
    
        <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/22629774-e9ca-49c4-a545-8a9651709b42" width="480">

        - $\large G^{1}$ has 3 isomorphic types.

            - hash(grey, 4 mixed, 2 grey) &emsp; → &emsp; orange

            - hash(grey, 2 yellow, 4 grey) &emsp; → &emsp; brown

            - hash(yellow, 2 mixed, 1 yellow, 3 grey) &emsp; → &emsp; blue

        - $\large H^{1}$ has 4 isomorphic types.

            - hash(grey, 4 mixed, 2 grey) &emsp; → &emsp; orange

            - hash(grey, 2 yellow, 4 grey) &emsp; → &emsp; brown

            - hash(yellow, 4 mixed, 2 grey) &emsp; → &emsp; purple

            - hash(grey, 2 mixed, 1 yellow, 3 grey) &emsp; → &emsp; green

    - Unlike 2-WL, 2-FWL succeeds to distingush two graphs at first iteration. 
    
    - As the refinement stabilizes in one step, 2-FWL terminates with a conclusion that two graphs are non-isomorphic.
