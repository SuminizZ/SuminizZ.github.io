## **HGCN : Implementing GCN in Hyperbolic Space**

<br/>

- Real-world graphs, such as molecules and social networks, have highly complex hierarchical structures that expands exponentially in space.

- Embedding these tree-like structures into Euclidean space that only grows polynomially can cause large distortion to the graph representation. 

- Hyperbolic space, with its intrinsic property to grow exponentially, allows optimal embedding representation of real-world hierarchical data. 

- HGCN (Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks) successfully combines this geometrical advantage of hyperbolic space to its great inductive capacity to capture neighboring node features and shows remarkably improved performance on both link prediction and node classification tasks compared to other GNN-based baselines.

- HGCN shows better class separation (indicated by different colors)

<br/>

- HGCN claims to make three major contributions.

    1. Derive the core operations of GCN in the hyperboloid model to transform input features that lie in Euclidean space onto the hyperbolic space.
