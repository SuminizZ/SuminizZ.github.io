## **0. Spectral Convolution Operation on Graphs**

<br/>

- **GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks)** : 

    - Aims to generalize convolutional networks (CNN) to graphs. 

    - **Illustration of GCN**

        <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/f76c2708-31e9-4395-9a16-3856b195fbe5" width="550">


- There are largely two types of convolution methods used in GCN, one is spectral method and the other is spatial method.

- For this post, I will focus on the spectral convolution method. 

- Spectral method performs convolution to graphs by **transforming the spatial node representation into the spectral domain** using graph fourier transform.

<br/>

### **1. Fourier Transform on Graph**

<br/>

- **Fourier transform of graph signal** :

    - Classical fourier transform is a linear combinations of orthonormal basis. (here, each basis is a complex exponential function with different frequencies.)

        <img width="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/8951b25a-65e6-4a58-8fa4-8093cf87956f">

        - top : fourier transform, bottom : inverse FT

        - FT interpretation : inner product between a signal and orthonormal basis functions.

    - Finding orthogonal basis of a symmetric matrix with real eigenvalues can be done by eigenvector decomposition.

        - Eigenvectors of real-symmetric matrix are orthonormal to each other.

        - [**proof HERE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OCM4C0rOnGjXjMjgvUpO2xVJbDLK6f_7/view){:target="_blank"} 

    - If one can find a matrix associated to the graph signal and that matrix is real-symmetric, then fourier transform of the graph signal can be done by the eigen-decomposition of the matrix. 

<br/>

### **2. Laplacian(Laplace Operator) and Laplacian Matrix**

<br/>

#### **2.1. Laplacian (Laplace Operator)**

<br/>

- Divergence of gradient vector.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/6aa749f2-eef5-429c-b31e-cfc56a8824dc">

- Measures the spatial variation or curvature of the scalar function : how rapid the graident changes near a point.

    <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/0037f0f4-9734-4abf-acf3-12139d1d329b" width="750">

<br/>

#### **2.2. Laplacian Matrix (Graph Laplacian)**

<br/>

- Application of the laplace operator to a graph is a laplacian matrix (graph laplacian). 

- $\large L = D - A$

    - $\large D(i, i) = \sum_{j} A(i, j)$

    - $\large A$ : Adjacency matrix whose element (i, j) is 1 if there's an edge between node i, j and 0 if not.

        <img width="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/416723da-295a-4ec8-ab14-a1b202782b80">


- As a difference operator, for any signal $\large f \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$ on weighted graph, it satisties

    <img width="316" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/c7b70bb5-df41-4c6b-8145-6494a05e6327">


- As graph laplacian is a positive semidefinite matrix (eigenvalues of graph laplacian is non-negative), it has a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors.

    - proof : Laplacian Quadratic Form, $\large x^{T} L x$

        <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/f80db82e-16dc-455b-a74a-73f756e1bb77" width="800">

    - Eigenvectors of graph laplacian : $\large u_{l}$ where $l = 0,\,,1\,,2\,,...,N-1$.

        - Corresponding eigenvalues are $\large \lambda_{l}$ where $l = 0,\,,1\,,2\,,...,N-1$, satisfying $\large Lf_{l} = \lambda_{l} u_{l}$

        - ordered as &emsp;<img width="355" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/1f604101-4a9e-4d88-a4c0-84cebbde5475">

<br/>

### **3. Graph Fourier Transform**

<br/>

- In **classcial fourier transform** of a signal $\large f$ is the expansion of $\large f$ in terms of the orthonormal complex exponential functions, which are the conjugate of the eigenfunctions of one-dimensional laplacian operator.

    &emsp;<img width="360" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/d2ef08bd-6b7f-4b71-bc28-4291a74d8f9a">

    <img width="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/a23b0f3d-daf9-498a-b8a8-4986e10ca0b0">

- Similarly, can define the **graph fourier transform** as the expansion of $\large f$ in terms of the eigenvectors ($\large u_{l}$) of the graph laplacian.

    <img width="310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/99ac1162-be8f-4629-b655-8a33eb6d6a5e">

    - **Inverse graph fourier transform**

        <img width="230" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/bccdd8c9-65dc-447d-a78b-38c279431963">

- In **classical fourirer transform**, the eigenvalues $\large (2 \pi \xi)^{2}$ carry the information of **frequency**.

    - Eigen-complex functions associated with large $\xi$ oscillates rapidly, whereas the ones with small $\xi$ has smooth oscillation.

- Similar interpretation of frequency is also valid for **graph fourier transform**.

    - Eigenvectors of laplacian coupled with smaller eigenvalues (low frequency) vary smoothly across the graph, eigenvectors with large eigenvalues are likely to oscillate rapidly.

<br/>

#### **3.1. Laplacian Quadratic Form : Meaure of Smoothness of Graph**

<br/>

- For the notion of global smoothness of a graph, one can define the discrete p-Dirichlet form of f as follows

    <img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/ecf6684d-27cf-4a91-a8f8-e66d72818381">

- When p = 2, it is the **laplacian quadratic form**

    - $\large S_{2}(f)$ has smaller values when signal $\large f$ has constant values acorss all vertices of the graph and quadratically increases with the disimilarity of signal $\large f$.

    - Hence, it can be a measure of the smoothness or the **frequency** of a signal $\large f$. 
    
    - **spectral graph theory**.

- This laplacian quadratic form can be re-expressed as $\large f^{T} L f$ where L is a laplacian matrix. 

    &emsp; <img width="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/7bbb97ec-be9d-4d7c-be3e-f301be0827a3">

    - Derivation is up above. 

    - Then, $\large f^{T} L f$ represents the frequency of the graph signal. 
    
- Now let's solve the optimization problem for laplacian quadratic form.

    <img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/40577577-7af2-4c3c-bc24-ccada9510806" width="390">

    - (1) : Define the optimization problem with a equality constraint $\large \|\|f\|\|_{2}\,=\,1$
    
    - (2) : Method of lagrangian multiplier
    
    - (3) : As $\large f^{T} L f$ is convex, the point where first derivative equals to 0 is the minimum the objective function with respect to $\large f$.
    
    - (4) : Result shows the eigendecomposition of laplacian matrix. 

    - **Solution** : $\large f$ that minimize the laplacian quadratic form are in the eigenspace of $\large L$


- Then, the magnitude of the laplacian quadratic form, the frequency of graph signal, is its corresponding eigenvalue. 

    - Starting from $\large Lf_{l} = \lambda_{l} f_{l}$, take $\large f^{T}$ to the left of both sides.
    
    - $\large f_{i}^{T}\,L\,f = f_{i}^{T}\,\lambda_{i}\,f = \lambda_{i}$

    - Eigenvectors associated with larger eigenvalues have greater disimilarities across the graph and vice versa.


- Embedding the graph with a set of eigenvectors of laplacian matrix with different eigenvalues. 

    <img width="630" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/ea60e064-c150-44cc-8f6c-35715f1e79e3">

    <img width="678" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/647a07d7-036c-4a8a-b319-a140715dac9f">

    - The variations between the signals of all nodes across the graph increases when embedded with the eigenvectors with higher eigenvalues.

<br>

- To summarize, eigenvectors of the laplacian matrix are the graph fourier basis where each eigenvector corresponds to a frequency on the graph depending on its coupled eigenvalue.


<br/>

#### **3.2. Spectral Filtering with Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)**

<br/>

- Graph fourier transfrom is a decomposition of graph signals in spatial domain into a linear combination of different frequencies, which are the eigenvectors of graph laplacian, in spectral domain.

    - **Eigendecomposition of laplacian matrix**

        - $\large L = U^{T} \Lambda U$ where $\large U$ is a set of eigenvectors and $\large \Lambda$ is corresponding eigenvalues.

    - **GFT of signal $\large x$**

        - $\large \mathcal{F}(x)\, =\, U^{T}x$

    - **Inverse GFT**

        - $\large \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\hat{x})\, =\, U\hat{x}$

    <img width="657" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/58f5eb5e-518d-467a-a2ea-2750fb94b3f9">

    - left : spatial representation of graph singal.

    - right : same signal in the graph spectral domain.

- By transforming the spatial graph signals into spectral doamin with GFT, one can filter the signals with desired frequencies.

### **4. Spectral Graph Convolution**

<br/>

#### **4.1. Learnable Graph Filters**

<br/>

<img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/70983063-cfb8-49cb-8d40-05e7ec52767c" width="700">

<br/>

- Operations in spectral filtering 

    1. **GFT** : Spectral decomposition of the spatial siganl $\large f$

        - Output : $\large U^{T}\,f$

    2. **Filtering** : Use spectral filters $\large \hat{g}(\Lambda)$ to filter the decomposed frequencies of the signal

        - Output : $\large \hat{g}(\Lambda)\,U^{T}\,f$

    3. **IGFT** : Reconstruct the decomposed signal into spatial domain 

        - Output : $\large U\,\hat{g}(\Lambda)\,U^{T}\,f$
        
        - equal as $\large \hat{g}(L)\,f$


- Final Output of spectral filtering : $\large \hat{g}(L)\,f$
   
<br/>

##### **4.1.1. Traditional Filtering Process**

<br/>

- Traditionally, this filtering procedure is done by non-parametric spectral filters that are pre-desinged to filter desired frequencies (low-pass or high-pass filters). 

    <img width="620" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/62b4ec84-b6b4-4793-b42a-0759fada1947">

- Hence, these non-parametric filters are not learnable.
   
<br/>

##### **4.1.2. Learnable Filters with Spectral GCN**

<br/>

- Instead, spectral GCN enables parametric learning of the filters by re-defining them in parameterized polynomial functions.

    <img width="680" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/cd6a2e44-7eb4-4cf2-8dfa-f5191e913ac9">

- Each eigenvalue is extended to polynomial series of $\large kth$ order, weighted by different parameters.

    - $\large \hat{g}_{nm}(\Lambda)$ (N x N) : 
        
        &emsp; $\large \sum_{k=0}^{k=K-1} \, \theta_{k}^{(nm)} \,\Lambda^{k}$

<br/>

### **4.2. Convolution Theorem**

<br/>

- Besides of filtering desried frequencies of graph signal, one advantage of taking GFT to convert spatial domain into spectral domain is that convolution step becomes much simpler in spectral domain due to the convolution theorem.

    <img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/52aa0477-72c4-4551-a963-ad90507c4690">

- **Proof**

<img src="https://github.com/SuminizZ/Algorithm/assets/92680829/d0a67802-6919-4407-8efa-134260272038" width="750">

- **Convolution in time domain**

    - A signal can be expressed as the sum of impulses in LTI (Linear-Time Invariant) system.
