### SR1, BFGS, DFP 

- SR1, BFGS, and DFP are all quasi-Newton methods that are commonly used for unconstrained optimization problems. 
- all use an approximation of the Hessian matrix to compute a search direction for the optimization algorithm, but they differ in the way they construct and update the approximation.
