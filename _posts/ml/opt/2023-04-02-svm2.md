- Soft Margin SVM that provides flexibility by allowing some classification error by introducing some slack variable for each data point 
- prevents over-fitting and enables finding decision boundary for linearly non-separable data 
- Kernel tricks are used to construct decision boundary for linearly non-separable data by transforming the data into higher dimension without explicitly computing it.
