- Proof that sample variance from population without normality assumption also coverges to chi-squared distribution as n goes large<br/>

    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; $\large \frac{DF}{\sigma^{2}}\,S_{n}\, = \, \chi^{2}_{DF}$ &emsp; (here, $\large DF$ equals to $\large \frac{2n}{\kappa\, -\, 1}$ and $\large \kappa$ is kurtosis) <br/>
