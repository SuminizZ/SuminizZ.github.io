<ul>
  <li>Optimization algorithm commonly used to solve convex optimization problems using Newton method</li>
  <li>starts with perturbed KKT by introducing a perturbation variable to complementary slackness condition</li>
  <li>involves introducing a barrier function into the objective function to create a modified problem that is easier to solve.
    <ul>
      <li>barrier function acts as a barrier that prevents the algorithm from reaching points outside of the feasible region. (inequality boundary)</li>
      <li>typically a logarithmic function that approaches infinity as the solution approaches the equality boundary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>solves equality constrained optimization problem by iteratively improving the solution untill the improvement is below certain threshold</li>
</ul>
